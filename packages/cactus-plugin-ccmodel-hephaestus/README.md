# `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ccmodel-hephaestus`

The package provides `Hyperledger Cacti` a way to generate process models from arbitrary cross-chain use cases. The implementation follows the paper [Hephaestus](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.20718058.v3).

With this plugin it will be possible to generate cross-chain models from local transactions in different ledgers (currently supports Fabric and Besu), realizing arbitrary cross-chain use cases and allowing operators to monitor their applications.
Through monitoring, errors like outliers and malicious behavior can be identified, which can enable programmatically stopping attacks (circuit breaker), including bridge hacks.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In the root of the project to install the dependencies execute the command:
```sh
npm run configure
```

Know how to use the following plugins of the project:

  - [cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric)
  - [cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/tree/main/packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-besu)


## Architecture

### RxJS Transaction Monitoring

This plugin utilizes RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) to monitor transactions issued in Hyperledger Besu and Hyperledger Fabric connectors.

RxJS provides a powerful framework for asynchronous or callback-based code, each connector maintains an RxJS `ReplaySubject`, named `txSubject`, which acts as a message bus for emitting transaction data.

- When a transaction is issued in a connector, the `ReplaySubject` stores the value it observes in an internal buffer. This observation is achieved by passing the value to its `next` method.
- When a new subscriber subscribes to the `txSubject`, it synchronously emits all values in its buffer in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. This ensures that subscribers receive the most recent transactional data, regardless of when they subscribe.
- The transactional data emitted includes essential information such as the transaction ID, timestamp, and other parameters, which are necessary for creating transaction receipts within the plugin.

### Cross-Chain Model Pipeline

The plugin employs a structured pipeline to create a cross-chain model from monitored connector transactions:

1. **Transaction Emission**: Connectors issue local transactions against their respective target blockchains. Each transaction's data is emitted by the `txSubject` to the subscribers within our plugin.

2. **Receipt Polling**: Upon receiving of transactional data, the plugin processes it into transaction receipts. This step involves precessing transactional information received such as transaction IDs, timestamps, and other parameters.

3. **Cross-Chain Event Logging**: Processed receipts information can then be used to create cross-chain events, forming a cross-chain event log.

4. **Cross-Chain Model Updating**: The plugin parses the cross chain event log and updates the cross-chain model with the new information received from the connectors.

## Running the tests
  - **api-surface.test.ts**: Verifies the successful loading of the library.
  - **cctxviz-basic-test.test.ts**: Conducts the simulation of a transaction without instantiating the connectors, and tests that the plugin monitors, captures, and processes the transactional data and creates a cross-chain event.
  - **cctxviz-persist-cross-chain-log.test.ts**: Tests the plugin's ability to export transactional data, in both CSV and JSON formats, as cross-chain event logs.
  - **cctxviz-generate-use-case-dummy-baseline-events.test.ts**: Conducts a simulation of a series of transactions, exporting the cross-chain event log in CSV and JSON formats, and tests if the cross-chain model is updated with the correct information.
  - **initialize-cctxviz-usecase-fabric-besu-6-events.test.ts**: Tests the plugin's ability to effectively monitor, capture, and process transactional data emitted from the RxJS ReplaySubjects in the Fabric and Besu connectors.

## Usage
Let us consider two conectors: one connected to Hyperledger Besu and one connected to Hyperledger Fabric. To monitor cross-chain transactions and create a cross-chain model we should follow the next steps.

After instantiating the connectors, we instantiate the plugin as follows:
```typescript
let hephaestusOptions: IPluginCcModelHephaestusOptions;

hephaestusOptions = {
  instanceId: randomUUID(),
  logLevel: logLevel,
  besuTxObservable: besuConnector.getTxSubjectObservable(),
  ethereumTxObservable: ethereumConnector.getTxSubjectObservable(),
  fabricTxObservable: fabricConnector.getTxSubjectObservable(),
};
hephaestus = new CcModelHephaestus(hephaestusOptions);
```

We set the desired caseID and start monitoring and processing the transactions into transaction receipts:

```typescript
hephaestus.setCaseId("Desired_CaseID");
hephaestus
hephaestus.monitorTransactions();
```

We can create cross-chain events from processed transaction receipts and add them to the cross-chain event log:

```typescript
await hephaestus
hephaestus.txReceiptToCrossChainEventLogEntry();
```

We can export the transactional data captured to CSV and JSON files:

```typescript
await hephaestus
hephaestus.persistCrossChainLogCsv("output-file-CSV");
await hephaestus
hephaestus.persistCrossChainLogJson("output-file-JSON");
```

And we can update the cross-chain model with the events created from the transactional data captured:
```typescript
await hephaestus
hephaestus.aggregateCcTx();
```
